# RECIPE GENERATOR
This website selects/generates recipes based on your nutrition goals and the ingredients you have at home! It was made with spoonacular API.

## Features
- Goal Selector (Bulking or Cutting)
- Can Input Specific Nutrient Goals (Protein, Calories, Carbs)
- Can input ingredients you have at home and want to use for the recipe

## Thanks and Getting Started
This is my first project using Python, would really appreciate feedback. Work in progress (maybe, if people like this enough I might add more features and a dark more.) **Suggestions and feedback are always happily accepted!**
(Again, thanks to Hack Club's High Seas for motivating me to build projects over the last couple of weeks!)
